Steps:

    Whenever a commit is made to the repository, GitHub Actions runs automatic tests to ensure the commit meets specified requirements by:

    1 - Gets the code from the repository

    2 - Sets up an environment to run the app

    3 - Runs a bunch of tests (elaborate later)

    4 - If it all checks out, it lets the commit through
